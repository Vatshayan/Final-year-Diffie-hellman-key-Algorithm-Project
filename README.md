# Final-year-Diffie-hellman-key-Algorithm-Project
Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange Method (hereafter called the D-H method) allows two parties agree upon a shared secret number, a symmetric key, over an insecure communications channel

# Diffie-Hellman-Key-Algorithm-Project
Top class project using cryptography. Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange Method (hereafter called the D-H method) allows two parties agree upon a shared secret number, a symmetric key, over an insecure communications channel.


Three Layers of security-
1. Diffie-Hellman-Key-Algorithm
2. Vigenere Cipher
3. polybius cipher

Classic Project !
